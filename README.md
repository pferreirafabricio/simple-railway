## 📖 About

Simple Railway is a C# application that demonstrates the use of Railway Oriented Programming (ROP) to handle errors in a functional programming style. This project is designed to showcase how ROP can simplify error handling by structuring functions and methods to pass errors along a "railway" of function calls, making the code more readable, maintainable, and less prone to runtime errors.

This project is part of a series of studies about error handling and classification. Checkout the others projects:
